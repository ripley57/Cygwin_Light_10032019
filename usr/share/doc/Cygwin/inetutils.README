inetutils  
========================================================================
Common networking clients and servers, including the inetd super-server,
telnetd and telnet, ftpd and ftp, talkd and talk, uucpd (but no uucp
client), and syslogd, as well as ping/ping6.

Most of these utilities are security nightmares, dating from a time when
the internet was a more innocent place. It is NOT recommended that you
enable or use ANY of these utilities -- except inetd and syslogd --
unless you have a VERY good reason [1].

With regards to telnet and telnetd, the cygwin 'openssh' package
provides a full replacement that is secure.

The ftp protocol is fundamentally flawed, but if you must use it, the
cygwin 'proftpd' is a more modern and "secure" replacement for the
server.  ncftp, lftp, curl, and a myriad of other cygwin packages may
satisfy your needs for an ftp client.

Does anybody use talk anymore, in these days of IRC and IM?

uucp is all-but-dead, having been formally shut down in 2000:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUCP#Decline
This cygwin port of the uucpd server is completely untested.

Concerning inetd and syslogd, more modern, secure, and flexible
replacements are available from the cygwin packages 'xinetd' and
'syslog-ng'.

So why is this package present?  Because as insecure and flawed as they
are, the telnet and ftp tools, servers, and protocols are still in
wide use, and their conspicuous absence would be viewed as a flaw, not
a feature.



[1] and even then, employ firewall protection and the tcpd tool from
    the tcp_wrappers package: see /etc/defaults/etc/inetd.conf for more
    information.

Port Notes:

This port supports only cygwin-1.7 or newer, and only Windows NT 4.0
and above (as that version of cygwin only supoorts these newer OSs).

By default, all services are disabled. You must manually edit
/etc/inetd.conf to activate any services.

The r* clients and servers:
	rsh rcp rlogin rexec
	rshd rlogind rexecd
are now provided by the 'rsh' and 'rsh-server' packages.

The tftp client and server:
	tftp tftpd
are now provided by the 'tftp' and 'tftp-server' packages.

inetd can no longer run as a service on its own. It can be run as
a service via cygrunsrv, which is how iu-config now and for the past
two years, has installed it.

In some cases, client applications may experience long delays during
authentication.  There are two possible explanations:

  1) Poor DNS configuration; make sure the client can do both forward
     and reverse DNS lookups of the server, and that the server can
     do both forward and reverse DNS lookups of the client.

  2) In some cases, the *client* machine must be running an identd
     server, so that the *server* daemon can do an auth callback.
     Cygwin does not yet have a ported identd daemon, but the following
        http://rndware.info/products/windows-ident-server.html
     works pretty well. It's a free-as-in-beer, but closed-source,
     identd service for Win32.  You'll need to open a hole in your
     firewall at port 113, for any identd service you install. On
     Windows Vista, enter the following command from an Administrator
     cmd prompt (or use the Control Panel GUI):
        netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="ident" action=allow protocol=TCP dir=in localport=113

Also, the inetutils-server package no longer installs the server programs
as `in.telnetd' and similar.  Instead they are are installed as `telnetd'.
If you have an existing /etc/inetd.conf file (or ./etc/xinetd.conf) you
should manually update these references, or run the 'iu-config' script
and allow it to update your inetd.conf file for you.

Be sure to read /usr/share/doc/inetutils/inetutils.OLD-README
Eventually the relevant information will be moved to this file, but for
now, be SURE to read that one...

User reports:

Achuth Sankar A 
http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-inetutils@gnu.org/msg01170.html
and private email. Not sure yet whether OP is using cygwin port
of server or client or both (seems likely it is both, but...)
    | 1)  Backspace won't work if we do telnet localhost. Or terminal in 
    |     which TERM=cygwin is set.

[csw]: Still present in this release. Will look into it later

    | 2)  When I start inetd service as SYSTEM user in win xp 64 bit,
    |     set UID error is shown when the inetd.conf file is updated
    |     to start telnet/ftp as admin user.

[csw]: Win XP 64 bit is actually closely related to Windows NT Server
       2003 (same kernel).  Therefore, it shares the "SYSTEM user can't
       change UID" restrictions that NT2003, Vista, and newer do.  The
       solution is to run inetd under special privileged account (e.g.
       cyg_server) rather than SYSTEM.

========================================================================

Change History
----------  inetutils-1.9.4-1 -- 18 Jul 2018 -----------
* Updated to latest upstream release
* Enabled IPv6 support
* Enhanced the /etc/ftpchroot parser on ftpd so that the root
  directory can be specified by the second field.
* Fixed an upsteam bug of talk that could fail to connect with
  a party if there are multiple network interfaces.
* Provide ping/ping6 commands within a separated ping package.

----------  inetutils-1.9.1-1 -- 23 Oct 2013 -----------
* Updated to latest upstream release
* Rely on cygport to autogenerate setup.hints
* Split package into client and server components.
* Added debuginfo package
* First cygwin64 release

----------  inetutils-1.7-2 -- 20 Nov 2010 -----------
* Removed tftp client and server; now provided by 'tftp'
  and 'tftp-server' packages.
* Updated wording of iu-config and syslogd-config scripts to
  eliminate confusion related to Windows XP 64bit behavior,
  and to remove any checks for legacy win9x (csih itself will
  abort if legacy).

----------  inetutils-1.7-1 -- 27 Mar 2010 -----------
* Update to latest upstream release
* Port to cygwin-1.7
* Removed r* clients and servers; now provided by 'rsh'
  and 'rsh-server' packages.
* Removed support for running inetd as a service on its own. You
  can still run inetd as a service; you just have to use cygrunsrv
  to do it.
* Added xinetd.d/ startup scripts for remaining servers.

----------  inetutils-1.5-6 -- 29 Mar 2009 -----------
* packaging update -- uses new csih 0.1.9.
  + exploit new csih_select_privileged_username '-f' option
    when iu-config invoked with either -y or -n.
  + add new --service-account NAME option to iu-config; uses
    new 'csih_select_privileged_username -u NAME' feature to
    override the *default* default cyg_server account.
* Fix regression in ftpd in which, when in active mode, the
  server opens a data connection back to the client from the
  wrong port (on the server). It was historically the control
  port - 1, which in most cases was port 21-1=20.  In 
  inetutils-1.5 it became instead the next available
  unprivileged port. Reported by Curt Gran; fixed upstream. 

----------  inetutils-1.5-5 -- 21 Aug 2008 -----------
* packaging update -- uses new csih 0.1.8. better support
  for using domain account as 'privileged' (root) user.
* Rely solely on _update-info-dir package to install info files,
  rather than explicitly adding/removing them manually, 
  and then having _update-info-dir redo the work anyway.

----------  inetutils-1.5-4 -- 29 Apr 2008 -----------
* no longer requires custom cygport
* fixed bug in ftpd that prevented large file transfers
  with recent 1.5.x cygwin kernels. Reported by antony baxter.
* fixed info file's index and internal navigation menus.
  Reported by Rodrigo Medina.
* Use readline (links statically)

----------  inetutils-1.5-3 -- 17 Apr 2008 -----------
* fixed bug in ftpd server that prevented authentication
* fixed bug in rsh client that prevented operation in any mode
  other than 'rlogin-like'
* fixed WinServ2003/Vista bug in rlogind where ROOT id was
  hardcoded to LocalSystem (18). However, this also exposed
  a bug in the login package (not yet fixed).
* removed erroneous warning message from rshd.
* Added support for parsing DOS-style paths in tftpd, recieved
  from tftp clients. (The tftpd command-line arguments must be
  in unix form, as always).
* silence warning in talkd when user has no ~/.talkrc file
* Lots of documentation updates

----------  inetutils-1.5-2 -- 29 Feb 2008 -----------
* disabled all services in the default inetd.conf
* updated default motd
* imported fix for rshd (and rexecd) from 1.3.2-40 release
* updated documentation
* fixed packaging bug
* inetd:
  + new macro CYGWIN_INETD_INSTALL_AS_SERVICE will eventually
    be used to disable --install-as-service option, but not yet.
  + check and use ...\\inetd\\Parameters\\ConfigFilePath registry
    key as a backup, if ConfigFilePaths is not found.  Also,
    warn if both are present but differ.
* use the new csih package to assist with service installation.

----------  inetutils-1.5-1 -- 21 Feb 2008 -----------
* Update to current release
* Based on 1.3.2-37 port, by Corinna Vinschen -- which was
  itself based on Sergey Okhapkin's original port to cygwin.
* Use cygport build framework
* Added startup script for use with sysvinit package if desired
* Added new command line option -T/--traditional-daemon for
  use with sysvinit-style control of inetd.
* New maintainer
